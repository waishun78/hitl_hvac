Controllers
############

Sinergym has a section to implement your own controllers. Currently, we have developed a **random agent** and a **rule-based agent** to 5Zone and Datacenter buildings.
You can find this code in `sinergym/sinergym/utils/controllers.py <https://github.com/jajimer/sinergym/blob/main/sinergym/utils/controllers.py>`__.
it is very useful in order to perform benchmarks as a reference point to study DRL algorithms:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../sinergym/utils/controllers.py
    :language: python

The functionality is very simple; given an environment observation, these instances return an action to interact with the environment. You can develop your own
controllers or modify current rules, for example. You can see an example of usage in section :ref:`Using a rule-based controller`.
