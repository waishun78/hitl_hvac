Deep Reinforcement Learning Integration
#######################################

Sinergym integrates some facilities in order to use Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms provided by `Stable Baselines 3 <https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`__. 
Current algorithms checked by Sinergym are:

+--------------------------------------------------------+
|                   Stable Baselines 3:                  |
+-----------+----------+------------+--------------------+
| Algorithm | Discrete | Continuous |        Type        |
+-----------+----------+------------+--------------------+
| PPO       |    YES   |     YES    | OnPolicyAlgorithm  |
+-----------+----------+------------+--------------------+
| A2C       |    YES   |     YES    | OnPolicyAlgorithm  |
+-----------+----------+------------+--------------------+
| DQN       |    YES   |     NO     | OffPolicyAlgorithm |
+-----------+----------+------------+--------------------+
| DDPG      |    NO    |     YES    | OffPolicyAlgorithm |
+-----------+----------+------------+--------------------+
| SAC       |    NO    |     YES    | OffPolicyAlgorithm |
+-----------+----------+------------+--------------------+
| TD3       |    NO    |     YES    | OffPolicyAlgorithm |
+-----------+----------+------------+--------------------+

``Type`` column has been specified due to its importance about *Stable Baselines callback* functionality.

****************
DRL Logger
****************

`Callbacks <https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/callbacks.html>`__ are a set of functions that will 
be called at given stages of the training procedure. You can use callbacks to access internal state of the RL model during training. 
It allows one to do monitoring, auto saving, model manipulation, progress bars, ...

This structure allows to custom our own logger for DRL executions. Our objective is to **log all information about our custom environment** specifically.
Therefore, `sinergym/sinergym/utils/callbacks.py <https://github.com/jajimer/sinergym/blob/main/sinergym/utils/callbacks.py>`__ has been created with this proposal.
Each algorithm has its own differences about how information is extracted which is why its implementation. ``LoggerCallback`` can deal with those subtleties.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../sinergym/utils/callbacks.py
    :language: python
    :pyobject: LoggerCallback

.. note:: You can specify if you want Sinergym logger (see :ref:`Logger`) to record simulation interactions during training at the same time using ``sinergym_logger`` attribute in constructor. 

This callback derives ``BaseCallback`` from Stable Baselines 3 while ``BaseCallBack`` uses `Tensorboard <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard?hl=es-419>`__ on the background at the same time.
With Tensorboard, it's possible to visualize all DRL training in real time and compare between different executions. This is an example: 

.. image:: /_static/tensorboard_example.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Tensorboard example
  :align: center

There are tables which are in some algorithms and not in others and vice versa. It is important the difference between ``OnPolicyAlgorithms`` and ``OffPolicyAlgorithms``:

* **OnPolicyAlgorithms** can be recorded each timestep, we can set a ``log_interval`` in learn process in order to specify the step frequency log.
* **OffPolicyAlgorithms** can be recorded each episode. Consequently, ``log_interval`` in learn process is used to specify the episode frequency log and not step frequency.
  Some features like actions and observations are set up in each timestep. Thus, Off Policy Algorithms record a mean value of whole episode values instead of values steps by steps (see ``LoggerCallback`` class implementation).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tensorboard structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main structure for Sinergym with Tensorboard is:

* **action**: This section has action values during training. When algorithm is On Policy, it will appear **action_simulation** too. This is because algorithms
  in continuous environments has their own output and clipped with gym action space. Then, this output is parse to simulation action space (See :ref:`Observation/action spaces`).
* **episode**: Here is stored all information about entire episodes. It is equivalent to progress.csv in Sinergym logger (see Sinergym :ref:`Output format`):
    - *comfort_violation_time(%)*: Percentage of time in episode simulation in which temperature has been out of bound comfort temperature ranges.
    - *cumulative_comfort_penalty*: Sum of comfort penalties (reward component) during whole episode.
    - *cumulative_power*: Sum of power consumption during whole episode.
    - *cumulative_power_penalty*: Sum of power penalties (reward component) during whole episode.
    - *cumulative_reward*: Sum of reward during whole episode.
    - *ep_length*: Timesteps executed in each episode.
    - *mean_comfort_penalty*: Mean comfort penalty per step in episode.
    - *mean_power*: Mean power consumption per step in episode.
    - *mean_power_penalty*: Mean power penalty per step in episode.
    - *mean_reward*: Mean reward obtained per step in episode.
* **observation**: Here is recorded all observation values during simulation. This values depends on the environment which is being simulated (see :ref:`Output format`).
* **normalized_observation** (optional): This section appear only when environment has been wrapped with normalization (see :ref:`Wrappers`). The model will train with this normalized values and they will be recorded both; original observation and normalized observation.
* **rollout**: Algorithm metrics in Stable Baselines by default. For example, DQN has *exploration_rate* and this value doesn't appear in other algorithms.
* **time**: Monitoring time of execution.
* **train**: Record specific neural network information for each algorithm, provided by Stable baselines as well as rollout.

.. note:: Evaluation of models can be recorded too, adding ``EvalLoggerCallback`` to model learn method.

**********
How use
**********

You can try your own experiments and benefit from this functionality. `sinergym/examples/DRL_usage.py <https://github.com/jajimer/sinergym/blob/main/examples/DRL_usage.py>`__
is a example code to use it. You can use directly DRL_battery.py directly from your local computer specifying ``--tensorboard`` flag in execution.

The most important information you must keep in mind when you try your own experiments are:

* Model is constructed with a algorithm constructor. Each algorithm can use its particular parameters.
* If you wrapper environment with normalization, models will train with those normalized values.
* Callbacks can be concatenated in a ``CallbackList`` instance from Stable Baselines 3.
* Neural network will not train until you execute ``model.learn()`` method. Here is where you
  specify train ``timesteps``, ``callbacks`` and ``log_interval`` as we commented in type algorithms (On and Off Policy).
* ``DRL_usage.py`` or ``DRL_battery.py`` requires some extra arguments to being executed like ``-env`` and ``-ep``.

****************
Mlflow
****************

As you have been able to see in usage examples, it is using `Mlflow <https://mlflow.org/>`__ in order to tracking experiments and recorded them methodically. It is recommended to use it.
You can start a local server with information stored during the battery of experiments such as initial and ending date of execution, hyperparameters, duration, etc.
Here is an example: 

.. image:: /_static/mlflow_example.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Tensorboard example
  :align: center


.. note:: For information about how use *Tensorboard* and *Mlflow* with a Cloud Computing paradigm, see :ref:`Remote Tensorboard log` and :ref:`Mlflow tracking server set up`

.. note:: *This is a work in progress project. Compatibility with others algorithms is being planned for the future!*
