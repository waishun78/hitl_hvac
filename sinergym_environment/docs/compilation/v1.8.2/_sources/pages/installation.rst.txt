Installation
############

****************
Docker container
****************

We include a **Dockerfile** for installing all dependencies and setting
up the image for running *Sinergym*. 

By default, Dockerfile will do `pip install -e .[extras]`, if you want to install a different setup, you will have to do in root repository:

.. code:: sh

    $ docker build -t <tag_name> --build-arg SINERGYM_EXTRAS=[<setup_tag(s)>] .

For example, if you want a container with only documentation libraries and testing:

.. code:: sh

    $ docker build -t example1/sinergym:latest --build-arg SINERGYM_EXTRAS=[doc,test] .

On the other hand, if you don't want any extra library, it's necessary to write an empty value like this:

.. code:: sh

    $ docker build -t example1/sinergym:latest --build-arg SINERGYM_EXTRAS= .

.. note:: You can install directly our container from `Docker Hub repository <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/alejandrocn7/sinergym>`__, all releases of this project are there.

.. note:: If you use `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__, by simply opening the root directory and clicking on the pop-up button *Reopen in container*, all the dependencies will be installed automatically and you will be able to run *Sinergym* in an isolated environment.
          For more information about how to use this functionality, check `VSCode Containers extension documentation <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers>`__.

*******************
Manual installation
*******************

To install *Sinergym* manually instead of through the container (recommended), follow these steps:

1. Configure Python environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* First, clone this repository:

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/jajimer/sinergym.git
    $ cd sinergym

* Then, it is recommended to create a **virtual environment**. You can do so by:

.. code:: sh

    $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv virtualenv
    $ virtualenv env_sinergym --python=python3.9
    $ source env_sinergym/bin/activate
    $ pip install -e .[extras]

There are other alternatives like **conda environments** (recommended). Conda is very comfortable to use and we have a file to configure it automatically:

.. code:: sh
    
    $ cd sinergym
    $ conda env create -f python_environment.yml
    $ conda activate sinergym

Now, we have a correct python version with required modules to run sinergym. Let's continue with the rest of the programs that are needed outside of Python to run the simulations:

2. Install EnergyPlus 9.5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install EnergyPlus. Currently it has been update compatibility to 9.5.0 and it has
been tested, but code may also work with other versions. Sinergym ensure this support:

+------------------+--------------------+
| Sinergym Version | EnergyPlus version |
+==================+====================+
| 1.0.0 or before  | 8.6.0              | 
+------------------+--------------------+
| 1.1.0 or later   | 9.5.0              | 
+------------------+--------------------+

Other combination may works, but they don't have been tested.

Follow the instructions `here <https://energyplus.net/downloads>`__ and
install it for Linux (only Ubuntu is supported). Choose any location
to install the software. Once installed, a folder called
``Energyplus-9-5-0`` should appear in the selected location.

3. Install BCVTB software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the instructions
`here <https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/bcvtb/Download>`__ for
installing BCVTB software. Another option is to copy the ``bcvtb``
folder from `this
repository <https://github.com/zhangzhizza/Gym-Eplus/tree/master/eplus_env/envs>`__.

4. Set environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two environment variables must be set: ``EPLUS_PATH`` and
``BCVTB_PATH``, with the locations where EnergyPlus and BCVTB are
installed respectively.

***********************
About Sinergym package
***********************

As we have told you in section :ref:`Manual installation`, Python environment can be set up using *python_environment.yml* with *conda*.
However, we can make an installation using the Github repository itself:

.. code:: sh

    $ cd sinergym
    $ pip install -e .

Extra libraries can be installed by typing ``pip install -e .[extras]``.
*extras* include all optional libraries which have been considered in this project such as 
testing, visualization, Deep Reinforcement Learning, monitoring , etc.
It's possible to select a subset of these libraries instead of 'extras' tag in which we select all optional libraries, for example:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install -e .[test,doc]

In order to check all our tag list, visit `setup.py <https://github.com/jajimer/sinergym/blob/main/setup.py>`__ in Sinergym root repository. In any case, they are not a requirement of the package.

You can also install from `oficial pypi repository <https://pypi.org/project/sinergym/>`__ with last stable version by default:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install sinergym[extras]

*******************
Check Installation
*******************

This project is automatically supervised using tests developed specifically for it. If you want to check sinergym has been installed successfully, run next command:

.. code::sh

    $ pytest tests/ -vv

Anyway, every time sinergym repository is updated, the tests will run automatically in a remote container using the Dockerfile to build it. `Github Action <https://docs.github.com/es/actions/>`__ will do that job (see our documentation for more information).

****************
Cloud Computing
****************

You can run your experiments in the Cloud too. We are using `Google Cloud <https://cloud.google.com/>`__ in order to make it possible. Our team aim to set up
an account in which execute our Sinergym container with **remote storage** and **mlflow tracking**.
For more detail about installation and getting Google Cloud SDK ready to run your experiments, visit our section :ref:`Preparing Google Cloud`.
