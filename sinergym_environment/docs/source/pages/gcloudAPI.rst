###########################
Sinergym with Google Cloud
###########################

In this project, we've implemented functionality based on the gcloud API in ``sinergym/utils/gcloud.py``. 
Our goal is to easily configure a Google Cloud account and integrate it with *Sinergym*.

The primary objective is to create a **virtual machine** (VM) using **Google Cloud Engine** (GCE) 
to run our **Sinergym container**. This remote container can update the **Weights and Biases 
tracking server** with artifacts if the experiment is configured with these options.

Once an instance completes its task, the container will **auto-remove** its host instance from 
the Google Cloud Platform if the experiment is configured with this option.

***********************
Preparing Google Cloud
***********************

First steps (configuration)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initially, you need a set up Google Cloud account and configured SDK (auth, invoicing, project ID, 
etc). If you don't have this, check `their documentation <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install>`__. 

Secondly, it's important to have `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ installed to manage these 
containers in Google Cloud.

You can link **gcloud** with **docker** accounts using the next (see 
`authentication methods <https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication>`__):

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud auth configure-docker

To avoid future issues with image build and Google Cloud functionality, we recommend 
**allowing permissions for google cloud build** at the start 
(see `this documentation <https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/securing-builds/configure-access-for-cloud-build-service-account>`__).

We also need to enable certain **Google Cloud services** in the *API library*. 
You can allow these services in your **Google account** using the **gcloud client SDK** 
or the **Google Cloud Platform Console**.

    - Google Container Registry API.
    - Artifact Registry API
    - Cloud Run API
    - Compute Engine API
    - Cloud Logging API
    - Cloud Monitoring API
    - Cloud Functions API
    - Cloud Pub/Sub API
    - Cloud SQL Admin API
    - Cloud Firestore API
    - Cloud Datastore API
    - Service Usage API
    - Cloud storage
    - Gmail API

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud services list
    $ gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
                             cloudapis.googleapis.com \
                             cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
                             containerregistry.googleapis.com \
                             gmail.googleapis.com \
                             sql-component.googleapis.com \
                             sqladmin.googleapis.com \
                             storage-component.googleapis.com \
                             storage.googleapis.com \
                             cloudfunctions.googleapis.com \
                             pubsub.googleapis.com \
                             run.googleapis.com \
                             serviceusage.googleapis.com \
                             drive.googleapis.com \
                             appengine.googleapis.com

If you've installed *Sinergym* and *Sinergym extras*, the 
**Google Cloud SDK must be linked with other python modules** 
for some functionalities to work. Please, execute the following 
in your terminal:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud auth application-default login

Use our container in Google Cloud Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our *Sinergym* container is currently uploaded in the **Container Registry** as a public one. 
You can use it **locally** or in a **GCE VM**.

.. code:: sh

    $ docker run -it eu.gcr.io/sinergym/sinergym:latest

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud compute instances create-with-container sinergym \
        --container-image eu.gcr.io/sinergym/sinergym \
        --zone europe-west1-b \
        --container-privileged \
        --container-restart-policy never \
        --container-stdin \
        --container-tty \
        --boot-disk-size 20GB \
        --boot-disk-type pd-ssd \
        --machine-type n2-highcpu-8

We also have containers available in Docker Hub. Please, visit our 
`repository <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sailugr/sinergym>`__

.. note:: You can change parameters to set up your own VM according to your preferences 
          (see `create-with-container <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/create-with-container>`__).

.. warning:: The ``--boot-disk-size`` is crucial. By default, the VM sets 10GB, which is insufficient for the *Sinergym* 
             container. This results in a silent error for Google Cloud Build, and you would need to check the logs, 
             which are not clear.

Use your Own Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have forked this repository and want to upload **your own container on Google Cloud** and use it, รง
you can use **cloudbuild.yaml** with our **Dockerfile** for this purpose:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../cloudbuild.yaml
    :language: yaml

This file performs the following:

    1. Writes in **cache** for quick updates (if an older container was already uploaded).
    2. **Builds** the image (using cache if available)
    3. **Pushes** the built image to the Container Registry
    4. Makes the container public within the Container Registry.

Don't confuse the option section at the end of the file with the virtual machine configuration. 
Google Cloud uses a helper VM to build everything mentioned above. We use this *YAML* file to 
upgrade our container because the ``PROJECT_ID`` environment variable is defined by the Google 
Cloud SDK, so its value is your current project in the Google Cloud global configuration.

.. warning:: Just like the VM needs more memory, Google Cloud Build needs at least 10GB to work 
             correctly. Otherwise, it may fail.

.. warning:: If your local computer doesn't have enough free space, it might report the same error 
             (there isn't a difference by Google cloud error manager), so be careful.

To execute **cloudbuild.yaml**, do the following:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud builds submit --region europe-west1 \
        --config ./cloudbuild.yaml .

You can use ``--substitutions`` to configure build parameters if needed.

.. note:: The "." in ``--config`` refers to the **Dockerfile**, which is necessary to build the container 
          image (see `build-config <https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-config>`__).

.. note:: In **cloudbuild.yaml**, there is a variable named *PROJECT_ID*. However, it is not defined 
          in substitutions. This is because it's a predetermined variable by Google Cloud. When the 
          build begins, *"$PROJECT_ID"* is set to the current value in the gcloud configuration 
          (see `substitutions-variables <https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values>`__).

Create your VM or MIG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a VM that uses this container, use the following command:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud compute instances create-with-container sinergym \
        --container-image eu.gcr.io/sinergym/sinergym \
        --zone europe-west1-b \
        --container-privileged \
        --container-restart-policy never \
        --container-stdin \
        --container-tty \
        --boot-disk-size 20GB \
        --boot-disk-type pd-ssd \
        --machine-type n2-highcpu-8

.. note:: ``--container-restart-policy never`` it's really important for a 
          correct functionality.

.. warning:: If you decide enter in VM after create it immediately, it is 
             possible container hasn't been created yet. 
             You can think that is an error, Google cloud should notify this. 
             If this issue happens, you should wait for a several minutes.

To create a MIG, first create a machine template:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud compute instance-templates create-with-container sinergym-template \
    --container-image eu.gcr.io/sinergym/sinergym \
    --container-privileged \
    --service-account storage-account@sinergym.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control \
    --container-env=gce_zone=europe-west1-b,gce_project_id=sinergym \
    --container-restart-policy never \
    --container-stdin \
    --container-tty \
    --boot-disk-size 20GB \
    --boot-disk-type pd-ssd \
    --machine-type n2-highcpu-8

.. note:: The ``--service-account``, ``--scopes``, and ``--container-env`` parameters will be explained 
          in the :ref:`Containers permission to bucket storage output`. Please read that documentation 
          before using these parameters, as they require prior configuration.

Then, create a managed instance group:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud compute instance-groups managed create example-group \
        --base-instance-name sinergym-vm \
        --size 3 \
        --template sinergym-template

.. note:: If you encounter issues with VM initialization, check your quotas 
          `here <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas>`__.


Initiate your VM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your virtual machine is ready! To connect, you can use SSH 
(see `gcloud-ssh <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/ssh>`__):

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud compute ssh <machine-name>

Google Cloud uses a **Container-Optimized OS** (see 
`documentation <https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs>`__) 
in the VM. This OS has Docker pre-installed with the *Sinergym* container.

To use this container on your machine, simply run:

.. code:: sh

    $ docker attach <container-name-or-ID>

Now you can execute your own experiments in Google Cloud! For example, 
you can enter the remote container with *gcloud ssh* and execute 
*train_agent.py* for the desired experiment.

********************************************
Executing experiments in remote containers
********************************************

The `train_agent.py <https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym/blob/main/scripts/train_agent.py>`__ and 
`load_agent.py <https://github.com/ugr-sail/sinergym/blob/main/scripts/load_agent.py>`__ scripts are 
used to execute experiments and evaluations in remote containers. These scripts can be combined with 
features such as Google Cloud Bucket, Weights and Biases, and auto-remove functionality.

.. note:: The **train_agent.py** script can also be used for local experiments and sending output data 
          and artifacts to remote storage, such as wandb, without configuring cloud computing.

The JSON structure for configuring experiments or evaluations is explained in the :ref:`Usage` section.

.. warning:: To ensure correct auto_delete functionality, it is recommended to use Managed Instance Groups 
             (MIGs) instead of individual instances.

Containers permission to bucket storage output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable the *remote_store* option in *train_agent.py* to work correctly, the *Sinergym* 
template in the :ref:`Create your VM or MIG` section specifies the 
``--scope``, ``--service-account``, and ``--container-env`` parameters. 
These parameters provide the necessary permissions for each container to write to the bucket 
and manage Google Cloud Platform.

To set up the service account and grant the required privileges, follow the steps below:

1. Create a new service account named **storage-account**:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud iam service-accounts create storage-account

2. Grant the *roles/owner* permission to the service account:

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member="serviceAccount:storage-account@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role="roles/owner"

3. Create a JSON key file named **google-storage.json** in the project root directory (this file should be ignored by git):

.. code:: sh

    $ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create PROJECT_PATH/google-storage.json --iam-account=storage-account@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

4. Export the path to the JSON key file as the **GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS** environment variable on your local computer:

.. code:: sh

    $ export GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS=PROJECT_PATH/google-storage.json

These steps ensure that the gcloud SDK uses the specified token for authentication.

Visualize remote wandb log in real-time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You only have to enter in `Weights & Biases <https://wandb.ai/site>`__ and log in with your GitHub account.

********************
Google Cloud Alerts
********************

**Google Cloud Platform** provides functionality to trigger events and generate alerts. 
We have created a trigger in our gcloud project to notify when an experiment is finished. 
This alert can be received through various channels such as Slack, SMS, or Email. 
To learn more about setting up alerts, refer to the Google Cloud Alerts documentation 
`here <https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts>`__.
