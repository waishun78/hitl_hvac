Extra Configuration in Sinergym simulations
############################################

Using `Config class <https://github.com/jajimer/sinergym/tree/main/sinergym/utils/config.py>`__ in simulator, we have the possibility to set up some details in our simulation. This let us to amplify the context of each experiment and have more parameters to investigate.
To use this functionality easily, you can provide this extra parameters in env constructor in this way:

.. code:: python

    import gym
    import sinergym

    extra_params={'timesteps_per_hour' : 6
                  'runperiod' : (1,1,1997,12,3,1998)}
    env = gym.make('Eplus-5Zone-hot-continuous-v1', config_params=extra_params)

Sinergym will modify this simulation model from Python code and save IDF in each episode directory generated in output. For more information, see :ref:`Output format`.
The format for apply extra configuration is a **Python dictionary** with extra parameter key name and value.

.. note:: *Currently, only code skeleton and some parameters has been designed. Stay tuned for upcoming releases!*

Let's see each implemented parameter for extra configuration separately:

******************
timestep_per_hour
******************

By default, a Sinergym simulation apply 4 timestep per simulation hour. However, you have the possibility to modify this value using **timestep_per_hour** key in `config_params` dictionary and set more/less timesteps in each simulation hour.

******************
runperiod
******************

By default, a Sinergym simulation episode is one year (from 1/1/1991 to 31/12/1991). You can use this **runperiod** key and, as a result, determine episode length in simulation. 
The format value for **runperiod** key is a **tuple** with (*start_day*, *start_month*, *start_year*, *end_day*, *end_month*, *end_year*).

.. warning:: If we include a manual runperiod with this functionality, we should not include any February 29th of a leap year in that range. Otherwise, the simulator will fail, since Energyplus does not take into account leap days and the weather files do not include these days.

.. note:: If you want to create your own extra configuration parameters, please see the method `apply_extra_conf` from `Config class <https://github.com/jajimer/sinergym/tree/main/sinergym/utils/config.py>`__.
